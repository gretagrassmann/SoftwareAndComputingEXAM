# Protein interface prediction with Graph Convolutional Networks
## Software and Computing for Applied Physics exam with Prof. Giampieri, University of Bologna 

## New activation function for the convolutional layers: tanh in place of ReLU

To try to improve the prediction of the [original model](https://github.com/pchanda/Graph_convolution_with_proteins) we try changing
the activation function for the convolutional layers from a ReLU to a tanh.
